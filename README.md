# Detectors
Here some codes for the characterization and simulations of detectors based on scintillation panels with _N_ pixels (Muon Telescope)

**General description:**

+ All codes are written to simulate general properties of a muon detector based on scintillating bar panels with _N_ number of pixels.
+ The **_calculo_aceptancia-Copy1.ipynb_** and **_calculo_aceptancia.ipynb_** codes calculate the angular resolution and acceptance of a pixel-based muon telescope in a pair of scintillation detection matrices. Some consequences and studies varying separation distances of matrices can also be calculated here with these codes.
+ The codes **_MuTeDirectionsToArea(Alpha)(Beta).ipynb_** and **_MuTeDirectionsToArea(Theta)(Phi).ipynb_** calculate the effective detection areas for discrete muon incidence addresses in the detector using the muon addresses as the starting point.
+ The **_MuTePixelsToDirections(Alpha)(Beta).ipynb_** and **_MuTePixelsToDirections(Theta)(Phi).ipynb_** compute illuminated detection pixels for discrete muon incidence addresses in the detector starting with muon addresses.
